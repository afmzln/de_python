# 🐍 Python Learning  

This is my personal **Python Learning Project**, created for hands-on practice and to deepen my understanding of Python **programming and problem-solving**.  

The project covers Python from **fundamentals** (comments, variables, data types) to **advanced concepts** like **functions, OOP, inheritance, multithreading, and external modules**. It also includes practical projects to apply the concepts in real-world scenarios.  


## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Build a strong foundation in Python basics.
- **Explore a new career path in data**.  
- Practice control flow, operators, and loops with real-world examples.  
- Understand and work with **data structures** (lists, functions, classes).  
- Explore **object-oriented programming** concepts.
